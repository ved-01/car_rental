# car_rental

Five technologies are used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL for the database. For running this project on your device you need to install xampp and create database in localhost/phpmyadmin with the name "carrent". As far as data is concerned I have used my friend's name while all the contact details is fake. 

For login credentials  you can refer the database.
